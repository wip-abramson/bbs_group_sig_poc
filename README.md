# BBS+ Group Signature PoC

This repo uses the BBS+ signature scheme implemented within Hyperledger Ursa to create a proof of concept that demonstrates how holders of a BBS+ signature (a credential in some use cases), can use this signature to sign arbitrary set of claims as a member of the group. 

Very PoC at this stage but believe it is an underdeveloped aspect of the Hyperledger Verifiable Information Exchange stack.
